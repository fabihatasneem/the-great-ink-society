“So, what was it last night?”
I really don’t know if these sessions do any help or not. I mean, what’s the point of all these sessions where your therapist explains your dream. Why do I need a therapist for that? I can buy a book for dream explanation and that would provide me more information than this session I am sure. But then again, I am here. These therapists have an immense amount of patience that’s for sure. Even if I plan to say nothing, they don’t leave me until I finally decide to change the plan.
“Nothing new. There were colors everywhere. More like color balls. Too many colors, felt like drowning. When I got up, I was sweating terribly.”
I was never an art guy. Don’t know how to put colors too. Seeing colors in dream do not go with me. It would go with Raka, with Ema. Not sure about Esha though, don’t know if she is obsessed with colors or not. 
-“I think we should start doing something related to colors.”
-“I don’t know how to paint.”
-“That’s the beauty of painting. There is no how to. It has no definition. You just do whatever comes in your mind.”
-“What are you suggesting?”
-“I am gonna give you a series of colors and a book. You will paint something with that color theme.”
Okay, now I am completely sure this session is of no use. Why am I even here? As much as I have told her about me, asking me to paint something after this really shows she herself doesn’t know what she is doing or wants to do. She wants me to do a series of colors where I won’t be able to do one!
-“I don’t think it will be a good idea. I really don’t know anything about painting.”
-“You will get hold of it, don’t worry. We will start from tomorrow then.”
Next day we don’t talk about my dreams anymore. I just take the book from her and come home. Even though I don’t plan to draw or paint anything, I still end up buying some colors. It’s been how long I have bought colors? Can’t remember, more than two years. I don’t know anything about them. So I don’t know which one to buy too. But I know what Raka used to buy. We used to come together to buy colors, me, Raka and Ema. Esha didn’t get enough chances. I would see them talking about colors, different names of colors. It was amazing, knowing those different names. And surprising too. Raka would explain to me which brands were good for what and many more. The joy in her eyes while explaining, I could stare at her for all day like that. 
I sit on the floor of Ema’s room looking at the ceiling. At her second birthday, we colored the whole house. Raka colored the whole ceiling as a big sky. It was way too beautiful. We wanted our kids to grow up as creative and broad minded as possible, but I only wanted it where Raka actually paved the ways. The color faded somehow, here and there, the dust is visible too. I guess it’s the sky Ema used to show when it started raining, “Look papa, the sky is sad and gloomy!”
I think of her at the strangest moments. Like when I’m filling a bag of groceries at the shop, and I remember her at age two, slipping away from me and making her way to that same aisle which must have looked like a free candy dispensary to her. When I found her, she was covered with full of chocolates and fresh open fruits. I was full of embarrassment and confusion over the situation, until she looked at me smilingly and I started to laugh. The manager, however, did not find the incident very amusing. He looked very confused, so I had to rush out of there taking Ema in my arms.
I bring out the book and colors, hoping Raka would see me doing this. She would be excited that’s for sure. She was always excited. She would start lecturing me how should I and where should I start from and I would stare at her eyes, again. Would Ema be excited too?
One is black. 
Black outlines everything. Starting with black, I must say as clueless as I thought my therapist was, I think she is a bit better. She wants to bring out the darkest memories from me at the beginning and pour it all on the paper. 
I remember the birth of my two daughters very clearly. Ema was almost three weeks early. Raka held my hands at the last moment and made me a promise that no matter what, I must save the baby first. At that moment, the world seemed dark to me for the first time. I felt like I was walking like a blind person, towards nothingness. My eyes were wide open, but everything was blurry, everything was dark. I sat in a corner away from my family and closed my eyes. If opened eyes can’t see anything, it’s better if they are closed. I was never a religious person, but I prayed my heart out that day. 
Raka and I both loved children. At the night of our marriage we were planning how many children we should have. Any normal human being would find the numbers in our discussion insane. But we were just like this. We wanted our home to be full of colors and plays and children running here and there. So Ema coming in the first year of our marriage was really special.
It felt like I was praying for eternals until a nurse came out with a baby in her arms and the little one was crying her heart out. I opened my eyes and the darkness was gone with the most beautiful thing on earth. I stared at her and kept staring, I knew I could do that all day just like I did for Raka. She was beautiful. When the nurse gave her in my arms, that moment was probably the best moment I ever felt and will feel. I felt the only responsibility in my life was, I had to keep her safe, no matter what.
After Esha was born, I was not the only one who was at shock. Children weren’t allowed there, but I couldn’t leave Ema behind. We were walking outside here and there, waiting for someone to come out of that door. She was constantly talking and asking me things. I guess it was her way to show that she was tensed too. When they brought Esha, I could bet Ema already felt the big sister role. She looked at her with so much pride that my happiness increased double that time. 
I guess I am not that bad at drawing. Outlined everything, made some shadows, feels good to be honest. Only hoping Esha and Raka were doing the same thing with me too. 
Two is brown. 
Brown is the dirt beneath the grass. Brown are the trees. 
I do brown very carefully and slowly. Somewhere beneath that brown, my life, my happiness is buried. Before our marriage, once Raka told me she wanted to make her hair brownish. I had the least idea of hair color and so I had no idea how it would look. But I always cherished the black hair. However Raka seemed pretty excited about that and she did it finally. It was damn beautiful. Even though I always liked the black as hair color but seeing her like that, I requested her to keep it for a while. 
Meanwhile, I'm staring at the dining room table, hoping a fully prepared meal might miraculously appear there.
Two years ago, it seemed this table was, indeed, a place of magically prepared meals. It was covered with homemade cakes, cookies, and, mostly brownies. Ema and Esha both loved brownies like they could eat a whole jar anytime. We used to have brownies two days a week. And the girls didn’t miss a day asking her mom, “Mom mom, is it bowiee day?”
I go to the table and find something my mother sent for me, as always. I don’t bother to look what it is. Grab the plate and put into the oven at 300 degrees. I put it on my fork and into my mouth mechanically, without tasting, because you still have to do worldly things, like feeding yourself. You still have to do them, even when your one child is dead and the other is not with you anymore.
Three is green. Grass and leaves.
I cry when I begin three, seeing the grass shoots come up from the dirt. I never knew grass could hurt, but it does, when you realize that time has passed, and grass is growing over your daughter’s grave, even though it feels like just yesterday that it was a fresh mound. Wasn't it just last week she was healthy, three-and-a-half, zooming down a twirly slide? Wasn't it just last month that she held her new baby sister on her lap, pointing out the tiny facial features with a chubby finger?
Except it wasn't. That new baby is about to start preschool. In a month she will be as old as Ema was when she died. And I’m terrified of what that means.
Four is pink. Delicate pink flowers. Just starting to bloom.
What happens when your youngest child grows older than your oldest child? There’s no answer in a parenting book for that question I guess. It isn’t supposed to happen. I held space for Ema, but now I worry, somehow the space is gone. Like the white in my picture, which is rapidly disappearing. I don’t see Esha anymore either. I bet people forgetting that she had a sister. Because I heard they barely speak about Esha anymore. She's just...disappearing, and I wonder whether she left a trace in the world. But inside of me there's still a grave, three feet deep, and it will never be filled in.
Esha will start her preschool in a few days. I can’t see her anymore. More like, not allowed to. Maybe if she starts to go to school, I will pay her a visit, from some place not to be seen.
I draw the pink with a trembling hand because Ema was wearing the pink too. It was her favorite dress that was gifted by her grand mother. It only took a few moments for the pink to turn into dust and red. I can’t remember pink anymore. It’s more like a shade of pink and red mixed now. I tried  to wash away the red. But I couldn’t be still, just like now. I want to throw things at the wall that had been taking all the hits since forever and scream like everyday. I am coward enough not do anything by myself directly but always hoping this screaming would do something, something out of the blue, just like the truck came out of the blue.
I haven’t talked about the day to anyone. But my therapist insists I should. The fact that I am here and my daughter isn’t, there shouldn’t be anything to say. Maybe I should get a job, as per my therapist. To make my hands full. I wish my hands were full. But the focus isn’t there anymore. There is no purpose. No matter how much I wish I weren’t alone, I can’t stand anyone. I just wish to be called papa once more. I just wish to be needed once more, the need to hold my baby girl’s hair while she vomits, again and again. To stay awake, all night, because she can only fall asleep sitting on my lap.
And somehow, I finish the pink. 
Five is blue. The big sky and the never ending sea.
It was a bright sunny day. I wish the sky remained blue rather becoming dark, so that maybe it wouldn’t happen. But the sky became blue the day we buried her. It felt cruel. The weather, the sky, why were they still nice and good? The sun could shine down and warm me, but the warmth would never reach her. She was too underground to reach her. She was cold. She would always be cold. 
It was just the next day, Raka left everything taking Esha with her. I couldn’t protest, couldn’t say anything. I was standing still at the door, seeing my daughter crying to reach out for me. I was standing still, just like having Esha in my arms, still, cold, going far far away from me. And the sky was still blue, the sun was still shining. 
I don’t want to finish. I want to leave these white pages empty, to show that I am not complete without her, without them. That I will never be.
So, I leave the blue blank.
